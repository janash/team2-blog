## A Little Bit about Thenuka!

Thenuka is from SoCal and lives near the beach! Before doing the MSSE program, he was an analytical chemist. He loves corgis and would love to have one of his own someday. In his free time, Thenuka likes to hang out with his friends and get food, especially LA KBBQ. Thenuka also likes to go to the gym and go for runs.

Thenuka originally was thinking about doing an part-time MBA with USC, but decided to join the MSSE program because having software and programming knowledge is becoming important in all industries. He's also interested in the materials science, biotech, and sports industries, so having software engineering knowledge will be helpful! (Also, traffic in LA is terrible.) His dream job is to work for Nike!
