## C++

Today in class we discussed fundamentals of C++ and went over basic syntax. Some of the things we discussed were:
* initializing main: this is where we run the body of the code. Other functions in the file are used in main.
* type definitions: when declaring variables, we need to specify what type it is (and we cannot change this later!). This is called "static typing." In python, the types of variables will change depending on what it's assigned to (dynamic typing).
* print statements: when we print to terminal, we must import using #include <iostream>
* terminal: we need two separate steps to compile and run the code. One step will compile and link the code (and generate the executable) and the other will run the executable.
* syntax: there are slight syntax differences between C++ and Python. For example, in C++ all lines should end in a semicolon. In addition, blocks of code in C++ are designated with curly brackets rather than whitespace in Python.
* scope: variables defined in a "scope" (ie in a set of curly brackets) cannot be accessed outside of that scope.
