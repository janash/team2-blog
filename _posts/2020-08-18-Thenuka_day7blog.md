# Day 7 Summary
Today, we delved into the support that C++ for arrays. Arrays in C++, like python, are zero-indexed. Unlike in python, however, the sizes of the arrays must remain consistent and would cause issues any alterations occured relating to the size of the array. We also went over pointers which allow us to store the memory addresses in new variables. Next, we discussed the power/significance of vectors, which work like lists in python in that they can be added to and resized. Typedefs can be used to simplify code in C++ and references can be used to store old values in newer reference variables. Today's lesson gave us tools that could be used to convert python code efficiently into C++ code and opened up better ways to compare python and C++ in terms of performance and their flexibilities.
