# A bit about Angela!
Angela is my teammate in MSSE and she is a recent graduate from UC Berkeley who majored in Chemical Engineering. She really likes corgis and she enjoys playing videos games and dancing in her spare time. She feels that not enough programming talent is harnessed in fields outside of technology and hopes to improve her programming skills to make a genuine impact in sustainability. In her opinion, the MSSE program will give her the tools to become a effective leader in terms of changing the outlook of sustainability and using computer science in more versatile fields.
