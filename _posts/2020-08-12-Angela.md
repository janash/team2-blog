## Daily Summary
Today, we implemented the Monte Carlo simulation to incorporate a non-uniform distribution of particles. Before, we were using a uniform distribution, which doesn't accurately take into account the probability density derived from thermodynamic properties. Therefore, we use the idea of importance sampling to sample configurations with the desired probability density. This desired density is described by the Metropolis-Hasting criteria.

Expanding on this idea, we also incorporated a pairwise energy calculation, which saves computation time and space. This function helps us implement the Monte Carlo simulation according to Metropolis-Hasting criteria.

## Daily Reading
A radial distribution function (RDF) describes the structure of an atomic or molecular system by indicating where there will be a higher probability of particles existing at a certain distance away from the particle of interest. For a fluid, since particles do not have defined locations to "exist," the RDF is sinusoidal -- at distances further away from our "center," the probability of finding a particle existing there is smaller. However, in lattice structures, each atom has an optimal location to reside (to satisfy the condition of having the lowest potential energy.)
