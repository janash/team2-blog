## Daily Summary
Today, we implemented the Monte Carlo simulation to incorporate a non-uniform distribution of particles. We also incorporated a pairwise energy calculation, which saves computation time and space.

## Daily Reading
A radial distribution function (RDF) describes the structure of an atomic or molecular system by indicating where there will be a higher probability of particles existing at a certain distance away from the particle of interest.
